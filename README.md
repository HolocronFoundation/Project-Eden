# Project-Eden

Project Eden is an attempt to:

- enable humanity to take control of their security, privacy, and data
- store core public domain (and some well-licensed) works, information, and pieces of software in a distributed fashion

These two goals are embodied by:

- Eden-1: A 1GB file-system which is usable and secure, enabling people to hold their own data and secure their own passwords and private keys in a convinient and portable fashion.
- Eden-1000: A maximum 1TB collection of files and software encapsulating a core set of programs and knowledge in a distributed and accesible fashion.

Eden-1 also enables complete access to Eden-1000, and Eden-1000 must be able to create instances of Eden-1.
