# Eden-1000

Eden-1000 is an attempt to store and distribute core public domain (or well-licensed) works and information. The Holocron.Foundation is focusing on The Library, but is in the initial stages of development for Wiki, and is evaluating what information should come next.

### Library

Library is a lovingly modified version of Project Gutenberg. The Holocron.Foundation is making modifications focused on decentralization - primarily on saving space, as well as creating utilities and portable UIs.

#### Development items

TODO: Create metadata packager and parser. The packager and parser should effectively prep the metadata for distribution on C.N. The parser should create a fully functional and searchable copy of project Gutenberg solely from the initial metadata as well as H.F. appended metadata.

TODO: Create HTML/txt to eBook formats. HTML/txt is the primary format of P.G., meaning that these are the files which H.F. should distribute, and users can convert these themselves to whatever is their desired format.

### Wiki
